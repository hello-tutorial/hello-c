Richard Stevens passed away before the third edition of
UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1 was published, but the
new authors, Bill Fenner and Andy Rudoff, have tried to carry
forward his intentions.  Mr. Stevens didn't include an explicit
LICENSE file in his original source tree, however some files
contained the following license text:

Some additional comments from his web site:

        [Richard Stevens wrote...]
        The code is available to anyone on the Internet and should
        compile easily on most current Unix systems.  The majority of
        the 10,000 lines of C code are functions that one can use as
        building blocks (a network programming toolchest) inside their
        own network applications.  Many of these functions help hide
        the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, and can aid the reader
        in developing protocol-independent code.
